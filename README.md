# NodeJs-JsonWebToken-Api
node Js api authentication with jwt
Server Run at Port 8080     (http://localhost:8080/)
I have developed a restful API in node.js .
in which Json Web Token is used to authenticate the user and a new user can register in it and can also login and logout in it.
To expire/end Json Web Token, session storage is used. If a user restarts a browser, the token will expire itself and he has to login again. 
Json Web Token will expire automatically after 5 Min. Anyhow, we can increase or decrease this expiration time according to our need.
